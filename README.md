# Code Cubile

This is project Code Cubile.
I use this repo to keep track of what I learn every day.
I code everyday and automate the basic git workflow using shell script to push my work.

### [Basic](./git-automation-scripts/basic.sh)

> Timestamp

The above script automates:

1. Staging
2. Commit message - Respective timestamp and date.
3. Push to origin main.

### [Not Basic](./git-automation-scripts/costum.sh)

The above script automates:
